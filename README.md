# TheGorillaProject
I have created a sample webpage for the Gorilla Tracking Safari Ltd in Bwindi, that can potentially be turned into a full and functioning website. In this prototype, we have included different sections that outline different aspects of the gorilla trekking experience, and each section can be further expanded into individual pages later on for the full website. Right now, these sections still give a succinct overview of the Bwindi National park, the mountain gorillas in Bwindi, and the different ways through which one can get involved. Our main approach was to address things we wish we could have known before the trek, the ways in which we can continue
